			<h1>SCHOOL</h1>
			<p>Like I said before, since September 2018, I am a student at HTBLA Leonding, branch Media-Technology.</p>
			<p>It's pretty cool here. The environment here is very nice & helpful - if you need help or something like this, they'll help you.</p>
			<p>Also it is very cool to get inspired by each other. For example, when we have to make projects - like making photos, editing videos or creating a website.</p>

			<h1>PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
			<p>When I was in the elementary school, my mother surprised me with a little camera for my birthday.</p>
			<p>Since then, I tried out so many different ways to shoot - I started with nature, then I tried archiecture, and now I love to shoot portraits.</p>
			<p>You always learn something new: settings, new perspectives - and you also meet new people!</p>
